# MNIST-digit-recognization
This project uses stochastic gradient descent to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST data, programming a neural network with forward and backward propagation from the ground up in Python.

I studied the detailed derivations of backward propagation in Nielsen's textbook Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
